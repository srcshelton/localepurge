.TH LOCALEPURGE 8
.SH NAME
localepurge \- removing superfluous locale data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B localepurge
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.BR localepurge
is a small script to recover disk space wasted for unneeded locale  
files and localized man pages. It will be automagically invoked by 
.BR emerge 
some day... 
You have to define the locale
directory names you want to keep from removal
in the 
.BR /etc/locale.nopurge
configuration file.
.br
Any other directory (or file) in 
.BR /usr/share/locale
not containing a subdirectory named
.BR LC_MESSAGES
will be discreetly ignored.
.SH OPTIONS
The configurable options consist of toggling verbose output, reporting a
summary of freed space, and deletion of localized manual pages in
addition to locale files.  All actions are specified in the
.BR /etc/locale.nopurge 
configuration file. 
For detailed debugging the commandline switch 
.BR -debug 
or just a short
.BR -d
instead are available for usage.
For verbose output the commandline switch 
.BR -verbose
or just a short
.BR -v
can be added. You can use too
.BR -help
to have help ;) or a short 
.BR -h.
You can use too
.BR -version
and if you dont like colors you can use
.BR -nocolor
or the short form
.BR -nc
if you want a pretend mode you can use
.BR -pretend
or the short from
.BR -p
enjoy.

.SH "A Word of CAUTION"
Please note, that 
.BR this
.BR tool
.BR is
.BR a
.BR hack
.BR which
.BR is
.BR not
.BR integrated
.BR with
.BR Gentoo
.BR Portage
.BR system 
and therefore is not meant for the faint of heart.  Responsibility for its 
usage and possible breakage of your system therefore lies in the sysadmin's 
(your) hands.
.br
Please definitely do abstain from reporting any bugs blaming localepurge if 
.BR you
break your system by using it. If you don't know what you are doing and 
can't handle any resulting breakage on your own then please simply don't 
use it.
.br
All locale directories containing a subdirectory named LC_MESSAGES
which are either commented out or not even listed at all in
.BR /etc/locale.nopurge 
will be irreversibly deleted.  The only way to
reinstall any lost locales is "remerging"
the ebuild.
